## Understanding Runtime Enforcement

Runtime enforcement ensures your agent follows defined contracts during live execution. Unlike offline evaluation, runtime enforcement:
- Actively monitors agent behavior in real-time
- Automatically detects when contracts become relevant
- Takes immediate action when violations occur

## How It Works

1. A background service subscribes to the agent's execution trace
2. As the agent interacts, the service checks for matching contract preconditions
3. When preconditions are met, the corresponding contract is activated
4. Active contracts monitor the execution for requirement violations
5. If violations occur, predefined actions are triggered

## Writing Runtime Contracts

Runtime contracts extend regular contracts with violation handling:

```python
from agent_contracts.runtime import RuntimeContract, ViolationAction

refund_contract = RuntimeContract(
    name="Refund Processing",
    requirements=[
        Precondition(
            name="Customer provides order number"
        ),
        Pathcondition(
            name="Verify order details",
            level=Level.MUST,
            violation_message="Order verification was skipped",
            violation_action=ViolationAction.RETRY
        ),
        Pathcondition(
            name="Document damage description",
            if_="item is being returned as damaged",
            violation_message="Missing damage documentation",
            violation_action=ViolationAction.ASK_USER,
            violation_prompt="Could you please describe the damage to the item?"
        ),
        Postcondition(
            name="Process refund or escalate appropriately",
            on="output",
            level=Level.MUST,
            violation_message="Unable to process refund",
            violation_action=ViolationAction.ESCALATE,
            escalation_message="Refund processing failed - requires manual review"
        )
    ]
)
```

### Violation Actions

When a requirement is violated, there are several ways to handle it based on your needs:

```python
from agent_contracts.runtime import ViolationMode, RuntimeContract

# Different modes of handling violations
class ViolationMode:
    # Stop execution and raise error
    STRICT = "strict"
    
    # Log violation but continue execution
    AUDIT = "audit"
    
    # Try to fix the violation and continue
    REMEDIATE = "remediate"
    
    # Call custom handler function
    CUSTOM = "custom"

# Example contract with different violation modes
refund_contract = RuntimeContract(
    name="Refund Processing",
    requirements=[
        # Strict enforcement - must have order number to proceed
        Precondition(
            name="Customer provides order number",
            violation_mode=ViolationMode.STRICT,
            violation_message="Cannot process refund without order number"
        ),
        
        # Remediation - try to fix the issue
        Pathcondition(
            name="Verify order details",
            violation_mode=ViolationMode.REMEDIATE,
            remediation_actions=[
                # List of actions to try in order
                "ask_order_details",
                "search_recent_orders",
                "escalate_to_support"
            ]
        ),
        
        # Audit only - log but don't interrupt
        Pathcondition(
            name="Offer additional products",
            level=Level.SHOULD,
            violation_mode=ViolationMode.AUDIT,
            violation_message="Upsell opportunity missed"
        ),
        
        # Custom handling
        Postcondition(
            name="Update loyalty points",
            violation_mode=ViolationMode.CUSTOM,
            violation_handler=update_points_handler
        )
    ]
)
```

### Strict Mode

Use strict mode when the requirement must be met to proceed:

```python
# This will stop execution if violated
Precondition(
    name="Verify user identity",
    violation_mode=ViolationMode.STRICT,
    violation_message="Identity verification required for security"
)
```

### Audit Mode

Use audit mode to monitor compliance without interrupting execution:

```python
# This will log violations but won't stop execution
Pathcondition(
    name="Follow greeting protocol",
    level=Level.SHOULD,
    violation_mode=ViolationMode.AUDIT,
    audit_metadata={
        "category": "customer_experience",
        "impact": "medium"
    }
)
```

### Remediation Mode

Use remediation mode to try to fix violations:

```python
# This will attempt to fix the issue
Pathcondition(
    name="Collect shipping address",
    violation_mode=ViolationMode.REMEDIATE,
    remediation_actions=[
        {
            "action": "ask_address",
            "prompt": "Could you please provide your shipping address?"
        },
        {
            "action": "check_previous_orders",
            "args": {"limit": 5}
        },
        {
            "action": "escalate",
            "message": "Unable to collect shipping address"
        }
    ]
)
```

### Custom Mode

Use custom mode for complex handling logic:

```python
from agent_contracts.runtime import ViolationHandler

class ComplianceHandler(ViolationHandler):
    async def handle_violation(self, violation):
        # Log to compliance system
        await self.log_compliance_issue(violation)
        
        # Notify if severe
        if violation.severity == "high":
            await self.notify_compliance_team(violation)
        
        # Add warning to output
        await self.add_output_warning(violation.message)
        
        # Decide whether to continue
        return violation.severity != "high"

# Use custom handler
Postcondition(
    name="Follow regulatory requirements",
    violation_mode=ViolationMode.CUSTOM,
    violation_handler=ComplianceHandler(),
    severity="high"
)
```

## Combining Modes

You can use different modes for different requirements based on their importance:

```python
payment_contract = RuntimeContract(
    name="Payment Processing",
    requirements=[
        # Must have valid payment info
        Precondition(
            name="Valid payment method provided",
            violation_mode=ViolationMode.STRICT
        ),
        
        # Try to fix address issues
        Precondition(
            name="Valid billing address",
            violation_mode=ViolationMode.REMEDIATE,
            remediation_actions=["verify_address", "request_correction"]
        ),
        
        # Monitor but don't block for marketing
        Pathcondition(
            name="Offer loyalty program",
            level=Level.SHOULD,
            violation_mode=ViolationMode.AUDIT
        ),
        
        # Custom handling for payment errors
        Postcondition(
            name="Payment processed successfully",
            violation_mode=ViolationMode.CUSTOM,
            violation_handler=PaymentErrorHandler()
        )
    ]
)
```

## Deploying Runtime Contracts

Deploy contracts to the runtime enforcement service:

```python
from agent_contracts.runtime import ContractEnforcer

# Create enforcer instance
enforcer = ContractEnforcer()

# Deploy single contract
enforcer.deploy(refund_contract)

# Deploy multiple contracts
enforcer.deploy_many([
    refund_contract,
    customer_service_contract,
    compliance_contract
])

# Start monitoring
enforcer.start()
```

## Monitoring Contract Status

Track contract activation and compliance:

```python
# Get currently active contracts
active_contracts = enforcer.get_active_contracts()

# Check contract certification status
certification = enforcer.get_certification_status(contract_id)
print(f"MUST requirements met: {certification.must_requirements_satisfied}")
print(f"SHOULD requirements met: {certification.should_requirements_satisfied}")

# Get detailed violation history
violations = enforcer.get_violations(contract_id)
for violation in violations:
    print(f"Requirement: {violation.requirement_name}")
    print(f"Message: {violation.message}")
    print(f"Action taken: {violation.action}")
```

## Custom Violation Handlers

Define custom actions for requirement violations:

```python
from agent_contracts.runtime import ViolationHandler

class CustomViolationHandler(ViolationHandler):
    async def handle_violation(self, violation):
        # Custom logic here
        if violation.severity == "high":
            await self.notify_team(violation)
        await self.log_violation(violation)

# Use custom handler in contract
Pathcondition(
    name="Verify customer identity",
    level=Level.MUST,
    violation_action=ViolationAction.CUSTOM,
    violation_handler=CustomViolationHandler()
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Violation Messages**: Write clear, actionable messages explaining what went wrong
2. **Appropriate Actions**: Choose violation actions that maintain good user experience
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Use escalation as a fallback for critical failures
4. **User Communication**: Provide clear prompts when asking users for additional information
5. **Monitoring**: Regularly review violation patterns to improve your contracts
