## The Fundamental Challenge with AI Agents

AI agents offer powerful automation through their ability to reason, plan, and use tools. However, they create a fundamental challenge:

**We lack a structured way to specify agent behavior and ensure reliability.**

Unlike traditional software with explicit code, AI agents powered by LLMs operate on natural language prompts, creating critical gaps:

- **Imprecise specification**: Prompts are ambiguous and can't cover all scenarios
- **Limited reliability**: There's no built-in way to verify if LLM-powered agents follow instructions
- **Flexibility-control tradeoff**: Detailed prompts reduce adaptability; general prompts reduce predictability

This forces developers to choose between agents that are too rigid or too unpredictable. Neither option works well for production, business-critical systems, which require both reliability and flexibility.

## The Solution: Agent Contracts

Agent Contracts provide a structured framework that addresses these challenges by complementing (not replacing) prompts with scenario-based specifications:

### How Agent Contracts Work

Agent Contracts follow a three-part approach:

1. **Define** – Specify expected behavior through contracts
   - Write natural language contracts for specific scenarios
   - Express business logic as verifiable conditions
   - Complement general prompts with precise requirements

2. **Verify Offline** – Test agent traces against contracts offline
   - Analyze execution traces to verify contract compliance
   - Measure performance across test scenarios
   - Debug and improve contracts before deployment

3. **Certify in Runtime** – Apply contracts during runtime execution
   - Check agent behavior against contracts in real-time
   - Enforce contract conditions when violated
   - Generate execution traces for continuous improvement

This structured approach bridges the gap between natural language instructions and reliable execution, addressing both specification and reliability challenges simultaneously.
