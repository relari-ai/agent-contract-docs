## The Challenge: Powerful but Hard to Control

Modern AI agents powered by advanced language models like GPT-4 and Claude 3 can plan, reason, and act autonomously. While this flexibility is powerful, it creates a fundamental challenge: ensuring reliable behavior while maintaining adaptability.

AI agents offer unprecedented flexibility, able to handle diverse tasks and adapt to new scenarios through natural language understanding. However, traditional prompting methods struggle to consistently enforce business rules and safety constraints.

## The Prompting Dilemma

When building AI agents, developers face a critical trade-off:

- **General Prompts**
  - ✅ Flexible and adaptable
  - ❌ Only 70% reliable, inconsistent behavior
- **Specific Prompts**
  - ✅ 95% reliable for specific tasks
  - ❌ Rigid and limited in scope

Neither approach is ideal for production systems that need both reliability and flexibility.

## The Solution: Agent Contracts

Agent Contracts provide a structured way to define, test, and enforce agent behavior without sacrificing flexibility. They work at three key levels:

1. **Define** - Create clear specifications for expected agent behavior
2. **Evaluate** - Test compliance before deployment
3. **Enforce** - Monitor and correct behavior in production

## Real-World Example: Refund Processing

Consider an AI agent handling customer refund requests. Without proper controls, even a well-prompted agent can make costly mistakes. Here's how Agent Contracts help:

## Benefits of Agent Contracts

### 1. Offline Evaluation
Test agent behavior against real scenarios before deployment, catching potential issues early.

### 2. Runtime Enforcement
Actively monitor and enforce business rules during execution, preventing costly mistakes.

### 3. Clear Specifications
Provide a formal way to define expected behavior, improving team communication.

### 4. Scalable Development
Build reliable AI systems that can grow with your business needs.
