## Installation

Install Agent Contracts using pip:

```bash
pip install agent-contracts
```

## Define Your First Contract

Let's create a simple contract for a customer service agent that handles refund requests:

```python
from agent_contracts.core.datatypes.specifications import (
    Contract,
    Scenario,
    Specifications,
)
from agent_contracts.core.datatypes.specifications.requirement import Level
from agent_contracts.core.verification.pathconditions import Pathcondition
from agent_contracts.core.verification.postconditions import Postcondition
from agent_contracts.core.verification.preconditions import Precondition

# Define a scenario for handling refund requests
refund_scenario = Scenario(
    uuid="sce-refund-basic",
    name="Basic Refund Request",
    data={
        "context": [{"text": "Customer wants to return an unused item"}],
        "tasks": [{
            "primary_task": "Process a refund request",
            "additional_info": "Order number: ORDER123",
        }]
    },
    contracts=[
        Contract(
            uuid="con-refund-basic",
            name="Basic Refund Contract",
            requirements=[
                # Verify inputs
                Precondition(
                    "Customer provides order number",
                    level=Level.MUST
                ),

                # Check process steps
                Pathcondition(
                    "Verify item is unused",
                    level=Level.MUST
                ),

                # Verify output
                Postcondition(
                    "Confirm refund approval to customer",
                    on="output",
                    level=Level.MUST
                ),
            ],
        )
    ],
)

# Create and save specifications
specs = Specifications(scenarios=[refund_scenario])
specs.save("contracts/refund-specs.json")
```
