## Core Concepts

Learn about the fundamental building blocks that make up Agent Contracts.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card
    title="Contracts"
    icon="file-contract"
    href="/define/contracts"
  >
    Formal specifications that define expected agent behavior. Activated by preconditions and enforced through requirements.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Requirements"
    icon="list-check"
    href="/define/requirements"
  >
    Rules defining behavior through preconditions, pathconditions, and postconditions. Support levels (MUST/SHOULD) and conditional logic.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Specifications"
    icon="sitemap"
    href="/define/specifications"
  >
    Collections of test scenarios that define system behavior, similar to a Product Requirements Document (PRD).
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Runtime Enforcement"
    icon="shield-check"
    href="/enforce/runtime"
  >
    Active monitoring with four modes: STRICT (stop), AUDIT (log), REMEDIATE (fix), or CUSTOM (handler).
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Evaluation"
    icon="magnifying-glass-check"
    href="/evaluate/evaluation"
  >
    Offline testing of agent behavior against specifications before deployment.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Telemetry"
    icon="satellite"
    href="/execute/telemetry"
  >
    Real-time monitoring of contract status, violations, and enforcement actions during execution.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Traces"
    icon="route"
    href="/execute/traces"
  >
    Execution logs tracking contract activation, requirement evaluation, and system state.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Violation Handling"
    icon="shield-exclamation"
    href="/enforce/violations"
  >
    Configurable responses to violations through error messages, remediation actions, or custom handlers.
  </Card>

### Offline Evaluation
1. Define contracts and requirements
2. Create test specifications
3. Evaluate and iterate

### Runtime Operation
1. Deploy to enforcement service
2. Monitor execution
3. Handle violations
4. Collect analytics

This dual approach ensures thorough testing and reliable production operation.
