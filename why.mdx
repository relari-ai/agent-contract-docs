## The Challenge with AI Agents: Powerful but Hard to Control

AI agents can plan, reason, and act autonomously, making them highly adaptable. However, this flexibility makes controlling their behavior difficult, leading to inconsistent decisions and unreliable outputs.

### Tradeoff in building AI agents

When building AI agents, developers face a critical trade-off:

- **General Prompts**
  - ✅ Flexible and adaptable
  - ❌ Only 70% reliable, inconsistent behavior
- **Specific Prompts**
  - ✅ 95% reliable for specific tasks
  - ❌ Rigid and limited in scope

Neither approach is ideal for production systems that need both reliability and flexibility.

## Agent Contracts: pushing the limits of AI agents

Agent Contracts provide a structured way to define, test, and enforce agent behavior without sacrificing flexibility. They work at three key levels:

1. **Define** - Create clear specifications for expected agent behavior
2. **Evaluate** - Test compliance before deployment
3. **Enforce** - Monitor and correct behavior in production
