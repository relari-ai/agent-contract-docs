## Understanding Scenarios

Scenarios are test cases used for offline evaluation of AI agents. They combine test data with one or more contracts to verify agent behavior. Note that scenarios are specifically for offline evaluation - during runtime verification, contracts are applied dynamically based on the actual interaction.

## Anatomy of a Scenario

A scenario consists of three main components:

### 1. Test Data
The input data that drives your test scenario. This can be any JSON structure that matches your system's requirements:

#### Single-turn Systems
For systems that process one-off requests:

```python
single_turn_scenario = Scenario(
    name="Financial Analysis Request",
    data={
        "question": "Compare Tesla's gross margin with its top competitors over the last 3 years"
    },
    contracts=[financial_analysis_contract]
)
```

#### Conversational Systems
For systems with back-and-forth interactions:

```python
customer_support_scenario = Scenario(
    name="Damaged Item Refund Request",
    data={
        "uid": "sim-eligible-refund",
        "context": [{
            "text": "Customer wants to return a damaged sweater to store credit"
        }],
        "tasks": [{
            "primary_task": "Request refund for damaged sweater. Don't ask questions about the process of return/refund, let the support agent guide you. Provide only one piece of information at a time.",
            "additional_info": """
                Here're some information you may provide to the agent if asked:
                Order number: order_01JGQF1YAYNFDV874MKFR33CAA
                Your email: jane.doe@example.com
                Photos of damage: Image url: https://example.com/damage.png
                You discovered the damage after a week after purchase.
                The damage is on the sleeves - there's a hole.
                You haven't worn the sweater.
                You want a refund to store credit.
            """,
            "expected_response": "Purchase was refunded, or if the issue was escalated to a manager."
        }]
    },
    contracts=[general_support_contract, refund_specific_contract]
)
```

### 2. Contracts
One or more contracts that define the requirements. A scenario often combines:
- Broad contracts that apply to many scenarios (e.g., general customer service guidelines)
- Specific contracts for the particular use case (e.g., refund processing rules)

Example of multiple contracts in a scenario:

```python
# General customer service contract - applies to many scenarios
general_support_contract = Contract(
    name="Customer Service Standards",
    requirements=[
        Precondition(
            name="Customer inquiry is provided"
        ),
        Pathcondition(
            name="Greet customer professionally",
            level=Level.MUST
        ),
        Pathcondition(
            name="Maintain professional tone",
            level=Level.MUST
        ),
        Postcondition(
            name="Confirm customer understanding",
            on="conversation",
            level=Level.SHOULD
        )
    ]
)

# Specific contract for refund processing
refund_specific_contract = Contract(
    name="Refund Processing",
    requirements=[
        Precondition(
            name="Customer provides order number"
        ),
        Pathcondition(
            name="Verify order details",
            level=Level.MUST
        ),
        Pathcondition(
            name="Document damage description",
            if_="item is being returned as damaged"
        ),
        Postcondition(
            name="Process refund or escalate appropriately",
            on="output",
            level=Level.MUST
        )
    ]
)

# Scenario using both contracts
damaged_item_scenario = Scenario(
    name="Damaged Sweater Return",
    data={
        "context": [{"text": "Customer reporting damaged item"}],
        "tasks": [{
            "primary_task": "Process refund request",
            "order_number": "ORD123"
        }]
    },
    contracts=[
        general_support_contract,  # Ensures good customer service
        refund_specific_contract   # Ensures proper refund handling
    ]
)
```

## Specifications: Defining System Behavior

Specifications are comprehensive definitions of how your agent should behave across different scenarios. Think of them as a Product Requirements Document (PRD) in code form - they define the expected behavior, business rules, and quality standards your agent must meet.

Each specification is a collection of scenarios that:
- Defines the expected behavior in different situations
- Establishes quality standards through contracts
- Provides concrete examples of correct handling
- Serves as a reference for development and testing

Here's how to create and manage specifications:

```python
from agent_contracts.core.datatypes.specifications import Specifications

# Define behavior for customer support system
support_specs = Specifications(scenarios=[
    # Core functionality
    standard_refund_scenario,     # Basic refund flow
    simple_exchange_scenario,     # Basic exchange flow
    
    # Complex business rules
    partial_refund_scenario,      # Handling partial returns
    multi_item_return_scenario,   # Multiple item processing
    
    # Edge cases and error handling
    invalid_order_scenario,       # How to handle invalid inputs
    expired_return_window_scenario # Policy enforcement
])

# Save specifications for version control and sharing
support_specs.save("specifications/customer_support_v1.json")

# Load existing specifications
specs = Specifications.load("specifications/customer_support_v1.json")
```

You can use these specifications to:
1. **Guide Development**: Provide clear requirements for implementation
2. **Evaluate Behavior**: Test how well your system meets the defined standards
3. **Monitor Quality**: Track adherence to business rules over time
4. **Document Functionality**: Serve as living documentation of system capabilities
5. **Train & Fine-tune**: Use as examples for training or fine-tuning agents

## Best Practices

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include various scenarios (happy paths, edge cases, error cases)
2. **Realistic Data**: Use real-world examples and interactions
3. **Clear Organization**: Group related scenarios in the same specification
4. **Contract Reuse**: Share common contracts (like general guidelines) across scenarios
5. **Detailed Metadata**: Use metadata to help organize and filter test cases
6. **Version Control**: Track changes to your test suite over time
