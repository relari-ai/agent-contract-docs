## Core Concepts

Learn about the fundamental building blocks that make up Agent Contracts.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card
    title="Contracts"
    icon="file-contract"
    href="/define/contracts"
  >
    Formal specifications that define expected agent behavior, including inputs, outputs, and constraints. Contracts serve as a blueprint for reliable AI agent development.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Scenarios"
    icon="sitemap"
    href="/define/scenarios"
  >
    Specific use cases that your agent should handle, containing test data, context, and tasks. Each scenario can have multiple contracts to verify behavior.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Requirements"
    icon="list-check"
    href="/define/requirements"
  >
    Rules that define expected behavior through preconditions (inputs), pathconditions (process steps), and postconditions (outputs). Each can be marked as MUST, SHOULD, or MAY.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Evaluation"
    icon="magnifying-glass-check"
    href="/evaluate/evaluation"
  >
    The process of assessing an agent's performance against its defined contracts. This includes checking output validity, constraint compliance, and behavioral alignment.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Runtime Enforcement"
    icon="shield-check"
    href="/enforce/runtime"
  >
    Active monitoring and enforcement of contract conditions during agent execution, ensuring real-time compliance with specified behaviors and constraints.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Telemetry"
    icon="satellite"
    href="/execute/telemetry"
  >
    Continuous collection and analysis of agent performance data, providing insights into behavior patterns, compliance rates, and potential improvements.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Traces"
    icon="route"
    href="/execute/traces"
  >
    Detailed logs of agent execution paths, including decision points, intermediate states, and final outcomes. Essential for debugging and optimization.
  </Card>

  <Card
    title="Simulation"
    icon="vr-cardboard"
    href="/execute/simulation"
  >
    Controlled environments for testing agent behavior under various scenarios, allowing safe validation of contracts before production deployment.
  </Card>

## How Concepts Work Together

The concepts above work together in a continuous cycle:

1. **Define** contracts and scenarios with specific requirements
2. **Evaluate** agent performance against these contracts
3. **Enforce** compliance during runtime execution
4. **Monitor** and collect data through telemetry and traces
5. **Simulate** and test in controlled environments
6. **Iterate** and improve based on insights gained

This cycle ensures continuous improvement and reliability in your AI agent development process.
