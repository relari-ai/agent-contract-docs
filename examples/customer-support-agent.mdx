## Agent Implementation

The customer support agent is implemented using LangGraph as a multi-agent system where a supervisor agent is responsible for routing each customer request to the right agent (customer agent for direct response to customer, database coodinator for database transactions, and knowledge agent for a RAG query to the company knowledge base).

## Defining the contract specification

This specification is made up of 4 scenarios: each containing the data for the testbot to simulate a scenario along with the requirements defined in contracts.

```python define.py
