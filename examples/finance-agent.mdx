## Agent Implementation

The finance research agent was implemented using LangGraph with the following multi-agent architecture. [Try for yourself](https://github.com/relari-ai/agent-examples).

<img alt="Financial Research Agent" src="/images/fin-agent.png" />

## Contract Specification

We can now define the scenarios and corresponding contract in a `Specification`.

<note>

Note that given that this agent is a single-turn system with a fixed input, we technically do not need the Precondition for [verification](/verification/verification). The `Precondition` in the examples below show the broaded definition for the scenario that could be used for [runtime certification](/certification/certification).

</note>

```python define.py
from relari_otel.specifications import Specifications, Scenario, Contract, Precondition, Pathcondition, Postcondition, Level

# Tesla Income Scenario
tesla_income_scenario = Scenario(
    uuid="tesla_income",
    name="Tesla Income",
    data="How has Tesla's net income changed over the last five years?",
    contracts=[
        Contract(
            uuid="ctr-tsla-income",
            name="Right Tickers",
            requirements=[
                Precondition("Question about Tesla's net income", level=Level.MUST),
                Pathcondition("Retrieve Tesla's net income with the ticker TSLA", level=Level.MUST),
                Postcondition("A numeric value for net income expressed in dollars", level=Level.SHOULD, on="output")
            ]
        )
    ]
)

# Nike vs Adidas Scenario
nike_adidas_scenario = Scenario(
    uuid="nike_vs_adidas",
    name="Nike vs Adidas",
    data="Between Nike and Adidas, which company has stronger operating margins?",
    contracts=[
        Contract(
            uuid="ctr-nike-vs-adidas",
            name="Right Tickers",
            requirements=[
                Precondition("Comparison between Nike and Adidas", level=Level.MUST),
                Pathcondition("Retrieve Nike financials with the ticker NKE", level=Level.MUST),
                Pathcondition("Retrieve Adidas financials with the ticker ADDYY", level=Level.MUST),
                Postcondition("A numeric value for operating margins expressed in percentage", level=Level.SHOULD, on="output")
            ]
        )
    ]
)

# Debt-to-Equity Ratio Scenario
de_ratio_scenario = Scenario(
    uuid="de_ratio",
    name="Debt-to-Equity Ratio",
    data="Which car manufacturer has the highest debt-to-equity ratio right now?",
    contracts=[
        Contract(
            uuid="ctr-de-ratio",
            name="Right Tickers",
            requirements=[
                Precondition("Question about the debt-to-equity ratio", level=Level.MUST),
                Pathcondition("Retrieve the financials of at least 3 car manufacturers", level=Level.MUST),
                Postcondition("Output a table", level=Level.MUST, on="output"),
                Postcondition("Include at least Tesla, Ford, and General Motors", level=Level.SHOULD, on="output")
            ]
        )
    ]
)

# Save a collection of scenarios in a Specification to be used for verification
spec = Specifications(
    uuid="yw936jmp",
    scenarios=[tesla_income_scenario, nike_adidas_scenario, de_ratio_scenario]
)
spec.save("specification.json")
```

Check out the outputed json file: [`specification.json`](https://github.com/relari-ai/agent-examples/blob/main/apps/langgraph-fin-agent/specifications.json).

## Running the Agent

Start the verification server from the `agent-contracts` directory (make sure you've downloaded and installed `agent-contracts` repo [installation](/installation)). The verification server includes the telemetry collector necessary to receive the traces from the agent instrumented with `relari-otel`.

```
cd agent-contracts
make docker-verification
```

Now run the app (the default command will run the scenarios defined in [`specification.json`](https://github.com/relari-ai/agent-examples/blob/main/apps/langgraph-fin-agent/specifications.json)). Make sure you've installed the langgraph-fin-agent [README](https://github.com/relari-ai/agent-examples/blob/main/apps/langgraph-fin-agent/README.md).
```
cd agent-examples/apps/langgraph-fin-agent
poetry run finchat --eval
```

You can now viwe the traces in the Jaeger UI at `http://localhost:16686`. Or you can fetch the traces via the Agent Contracts CLI.

<pre style={{ fontFamily: '"Space Mono", monospace', lineHeight: '1.2em' }}>
$ poetry run cli ls run --timespan 1h
Listing runs from 2025-03-11 04:27:05.937162+00:00 to 2025-03-11 05:27:05.937158+00:00...

## Verification Results

The following is the verification results post-execution. We can see that the `con-comparison` and `con-analysis` contracts are satisfied while the `con-liquidity-analysis` contract is not.
