## Agent Implementation

The customer support agent is implemented using LangGraph as a multi-agent system where a supervisor agent is responsible for routing each customer request to the right agent (customer agent for direct response to customer, database coodinator for database transactions, and knowledge agent for a RAG query to the company knowledge base).

## Defining the contract specification

This specification is made up of 4 scenarios: each containing the data for the testbot to simulate a scenario along with the requirements defined in contracts.

```python define.py
from relari_otel.specifications import Specifications, Scenario, Contract, Precondition, Pathcondition, Postcondition, Level

## Run Simulation

Conversations are simulated using the Relari Testbot for each scenario. Check out more details in the [Simulation](/verification/simulation) section.

<img alt="Customer support simulation dark" className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/customer-support-simulation-dark.png" />

## Verification Results

The following is the verification results post-execution. We can see that the `con-shipping-1` and `con-product-1` contract are satisfied while the `con-refund-1` and `con-refund-2` contracts are not. 

The detailed verification results with reasoning are saved in the `output/verify_4cf4b3f5.json` file.
