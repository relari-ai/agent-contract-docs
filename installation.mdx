In this section, we will show how to quickly instrument your agent code to collect traces and install agent contracts to run offline verification or runtime certification.


<Steps>
  <Step title="Install agent contracts">
    Install agent contracts.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/relari-ai/agent-contracts.git
    cd agent-contracts
    poetry install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install relari-otel in your Agent">
    In your agent repository, install the `relari-otel` package to collect traces.

    ```bash
    pip install relari-otel
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Option A: Set up Agent Contracts for Offline Verification">
    
    Start agent contract service for verification.

    ```bash
    cd agent-contracts
    make docker
    ```

    Initialize telemetry code in your agent code

    ```python app.py
    from relari_otel.otel import Relari

    Relari.init(project_name="Your Project Name", batch=False)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Option B: Set up Agent Contracts for Runtime Certification">
    
    Start agent contract service for runtime certification.

    ```bash
    cd agent-contracts
    make docker-runtime-certification
    ```

    Initialize telemetry code in your agent code

    ```python app.py
    from relari_otel.otel import Relari

    Relari.init(project_name="Your Project Name", batch=False, certification_enabled=True)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
