## Understanding Contracts

Contracts define the expected behavior of an AI agent through requirements. They help ensure that agents follow business rules and handle interactions appropriately. A contract is essentially a set of requirements for a specific scenario - for example, how an agent should handle a refund request or generate a report.

## Requirements

Requirements are the atomic units of contracts. Each requirement represents a specific condition or constraint that must be satisfied. They come in three types, each serving a distinct purpose in controlling and validating agent behavior:

<img alt="Requirement Dark" className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/requirement-types.png" />

### Requirement Properties

Each requirement has several properties:

1. **name**: The description of what needs to be checked
2. **if_**: A condition that determines when this requirement applies (named `if_` because `if` is a Python reserved keyword)
3. **level** (optional): The importance level (`MUST` or `SHOULD`, defaults to `MUST`)

The `if_` condition allows you to make requirements contextual. For example:

```python
# Only check inventory if the customer wants immediate pickup
Pathcondition(
    name="Check store inventory for item availability",
    if_="customer requests in-store pickup",  # Note: if_ not if (Python reserved word)
    level=Level.MUST
)

# Only verify shipping address for physical items
Precondition(
    name="Customer provides valid shipping address",
    if_="product is a physical item",
    # level defaults to MUST when not specified
)
```

### 1. Preconditions

Preconditions verify that necessary inputs or conditions are met before the agent proceeds. They serve two critical purposes:

1. **Evaluation**: They help validate if the agent received the correct inputs to act. If preconditions aren't met (e.g., customer never provided an order number), the contract is invalidated since the agent didn't have the necessary information to proceed.

2. **Runtime Detection**: They act as scenario detectors during runtime enforcement. When preconditions are met, we know we're in a specific scenario and can apply the corresponding path and post conditions.

Example preconditions:

```python
from agent_contracts.core.datatypes.specifications import Level

# Basic precondition - level defaults to MUST
Precondition(
    name="Customer provides order number"
)

# Conditional documentation requirement
Precondition(
    name="Customer provides proof of damage",
    if_="item is being returned as damaged",
    level=Level.SHOULD
)

# Multiple conditions example
Precondition(
    name="Customer provides gift receipt",
    if_="item was marked as gift during purchase",
    level=Level.MUST
)
```

### 2. Pathconditions

Pathconditions are the most flexible type of requirement, designed to validate the agent's execution process. They can check:
- Tool usage and sequence
- Reasoning steps
- Information gathering
- Decision-making process
- Any aspect of the execution trace

Example pathconditions with conditions:

```python
# Conditional verification steps
Pathcondition(
    name="Verify item authenticity with brand database",
    if_="item price exceeds $1000",
    level=Level.MUST
)

# Process flow requirements
Pathcondition(
    name="Get manager approval",
    if_="refund amount exceeds store policy limit",
    # level defaults to MUST
)

# Customer interaction requirements
Pathcondition(
    name="Offer alternative product suggestions",
    if_="reason for return is 'not satisfied with product'",
    level=Level.SHOULD
)
```

### 3. Postconditions

Postconditions verify the final output or result. They must specify what they're checking using the `on` field:

- `on="output"`: Checks the final result (e.g., database entries, generated reports)
- `on="conversation"`: Validates the agent's communication with the user

Examples with conditional requirements:

```python
# Conditional database updates
Postcondition(
    name="Update customer loyalty points",
    if_="customer is a loyalty program member",
    on="output"
)

# Conditional communication requirements
Postcondition(
    name="Provide estimated delivery date",
    if_="customer chose home delivery",
    on="conversation",
    level=Level.MUST
)

# Quality checks with conditions
Postcondition(
    name="Include competitor price comparison",
    if_="price match was requested",
    on="output",
    level=Level.SHOULD
)
```

## Requirement Levels

Requirements can have different levels of importance:

- `Level.MUST`: Critical requirements that must be met (default when level is not specified)
- `Level.SHOULD`: Important but not critical requirements that represent best practices

## Creating Contracts

A contract combines these requirements to fully specify how an agent should handle a scenario:

```python
from agent_contracts.core.datatypes.specifications import Contract

refund_contract = Contract(
    name="Damaged Item Refund Processing",
    requirements=[
        # Input validation
        Precondition(
            name="Customer provides order number"
            # level defaults to MUST
        ),
        Precondition(
            name="Customer provides damage description",
            if_="item is being returned as damaged"
        ),
        
        # Process steps
        Pathcondition(
            name="Document damage with photos",
            if_="item value exceeds $100"
        ),
        Pathcondition(
            name="Get department manager approval",
            if_="refund amount > $500",
            level=Level.MUST
        ),
        
        # Output validation
        Postcondition(
            name="Send return shipping label",
            if_="customer chose mail-in return",
            on="output"
        ),
        Postcondition(
            name="Provide estimated refund processing time",
            on="conversation"
        )
    ]
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Requirements**: Write requirements that are specific and measurable
2. **Appropriate Conditions**: Use `if_` conditions to handle different scenarios within the same contract
3. **Default Levels**: Remember that `level` defaults to `MUST` - only specify `SHOULD` when needed
4. **Logical Flow**: Ensure pathconditions reflect the natural sequence of operations
5. **Testable Outputs**: Make postconditions concrete and verifiable
